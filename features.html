          <p>At the start of your season, you quickly set up all fixture and 
          practice times. We'll remind you weekly to fill in details for the 
          upcoming week's schedule.</p>
          <p>Your managers and coaches will receive that
          week's schedule, knowing exactly where they need to be, 
          when they need to be there.</p>
          <p>Should there be any changes, Sportomatic
          will make sure that relevant people are notified.</p>

          <p>Sportomatic has a unique hour logging system that logs coaches in
          when they show up for practice and logs them out when they leave.

          coaches, with other features that stretch this even further.</p>
        </section>

          <h3>Track trends to optimise results.</h3>
          <p>It's often difficult to get a feel for the bigger picture. Do you need

          coaches missing practices?</p>
          <p>Sportomatic will generate graphical representations of the data it
